# HatRed
Dataset and code implementation for the paper "HatRed: Decoding the Underlying Meaning of Multimodal Hateful Memes" (IJCAI'23).

Note that researchers will have to agree with Facebook's data access agreement to download the memes. The link to annotated hateful reasons will be made available separately in the camera-ready version.
